# In HTML 

1 - write anchor tag like this

	<a href="/projects">Visit Our Properties</a>

	and not like this
	     <a href="#"><span>Visit Our Properties</span></a>

--> Remove the span tag

2 - don't put pngs for small images, convert them into data uri


# In SCSS
1	avoid using multiple values for margin/padding - 
	like this
		padding: 0 5%;
		padding-top: 10rem;
		padding-bottom: 6rem;

2	try to use shorthand like this
		padding: 10rem 5% 10rem;	

3	for display: flex; flex-direction: row: is default

4 	carefully look into the screen in each section , some sections look absurd
give them required padding, margin to make it look appropriate

5 replace width with max-width better for responsiveness

6 name the classes properly, box1 then box2 ...etc

7 if font size decreases then line height also decreases in that ratio

8 always put background-size: either 100%, or 100% 100% or cover.

9 background-position: x y

x - top/bottom/center
y - right/left/center
